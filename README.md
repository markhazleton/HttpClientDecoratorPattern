# Decorator Design Pattern

## Adding Telemetry to HttpClient

This repository demonstrates how to use the decorator design pattern to add telemetry to an HttpClient. 

The **Decorator Pattern** is a design pattern that allows developers to add additional functionality to existing 
classes/objects without modifying the existing class/object. 

This repository demonstrates how to use the decorator design pattern to add telemetry 
to an HttpClient in C#. By the end of this demonstration, you will have a good understanding 
of the decorator pattern and how to use it to add telemetry to an HttpClient.

By using the Decorator Pattern, developers can add 
additional properties and methods to the existing HttpClient class to add telemetry data to the request. 
This allows for easy tracking of requests and their associated data, such as request time, response time, and response size. 
By using the Decorator Pattern, the original HttpClient class remains unchanged, and the telemetry data is added 
through a “wrapper” or “decorator” class. This makes the code more maintainable, as the changes are isolated to 
the decorator class, while the original HttpClient class remains unchanged.


## Motivation
To have a working version of the decorator pattern in C# with a real world example.

### What is HttpClient?
HttpClient is a modern, easy-to-use, and powerful HTTP client library that is built 
into .NET. It provides a simple, asynchronous, and extensible way to make HTTP requests 
and can be used in any .NET application, including .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and UWP.

### What is Telemetry?
Telemetry is the collection, transmission, and analysis of data related to the performance and 
usage of an application. Telemetry helps us to monitor the performance of an application, 
identify and troubleshoot issues, and understand how an application is being used.

### Conclusion
This repository demonstrates the power and flexibility of the decorator design pattern, and shows how to use it to add telemetry to an HttpClient in C#. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
