# HttpClientDecoratorPattern
Decorator Design Pattern: Adding Telemetry to HttpClient
## Introduction
The decorator design pattern is a powerful technique in object-oriented programming that allows you to extend the functionality of an object at runtime. This repository demonstrates how to use the decorator design pattern to add telemetry to an HttpClient in C#. By the end of this demonstration, you will have a good understanding of the decorator pattern and how to use it to add telemetry to an HttpClient.

## What is HttpClient?
HttpClient is a modern, easy-to-use, and powerful HTTP client library that is built into .NET. It provides a simple, asynchronous, and extensible way to make HTTP requests and can be used in any .NET application, including .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and UWP.

## What is Telemetry?
Telemetry is the collection, transmission, and analysis of data related to the performance and usage of an application. Telemetry helps us to monitor the performance of an application, identify and troubleshoot issues, and understand how an application is being used.

## Demonstration
This repository demonstrates how to use the decorator design pattern to add telemetry to an HttpClient. The code in this repository includes the following:

The TelemetryDecorator class that implements the decorator pattern and adds the telemetry functionality.
Example code that shows how to use the TelemetryDecorator class with an HttpClient.
## Usage
1 Clone this repository to your local machine.
1 Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
1 Run the project to see the demonstration in action.

## Conclusion
This repository demonstrates the power and flexibility of the decorator design pattern, and shows how to use it to add telemetry to an HttpClient in C#. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
